# Bonding Curve Playground

A web app to experiment and play with token bonding curve design.

Now with decimation, downsampling, interpolation, and memoization included...

## Hosting

This project is hosted at `https://bonding-curve-playground.netlify.app/`. It's deployed from the master branch. We will integrate a proper deployment pipeline in with automated testing in due course!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Roadmap

As we get more contributors onboard we'll define the roadmap a bit better, defining what useful features we'd like to develop.

### Future Features

Some initial ideas for needed features, and features currently being developed:

1. Trading simulator interface - this is in active development, see the relevant branch
2. Curve parameter controls, for example sliders, live updates, guided examples and interaction, etc.
